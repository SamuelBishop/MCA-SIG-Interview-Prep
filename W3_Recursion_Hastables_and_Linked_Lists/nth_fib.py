'''
The Fibonacci sequence is dened as follows: the rst number of the sequence is 0 , the
second number is 1 , and the nth number is the sum of the (n - 1)th and (n - 2)th numbers.
Write a function that takes in an integer n and returns the nth Fibonacci number.
Important note: the Fibonacci sequence is often dened with its rst two numbers as
F0 = 0 and F1 = 1 . For the purpose of this question, the rst Fibonacci number is F0 ;
therefore, getNthFib(1) is equal to F0 , getNthFib(2) is equal to F1 , etc..

Sample Input #1
n = 2

Sample Output #1
1 # The sum of 0 and 1
